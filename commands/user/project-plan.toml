Act as a Technical Lead. Using `spec.md`, draft a step-by-step blueprint.

Rules:
1. **Iterative**: Break the project into small, safe chunks.
2. **TDD**: Ensure every step includes writing tests before implementation.
3. **Prompt Sequence**: Output a series of LLM prompts (in code blocks) that I can use to generate the code.
4. **Integration**: Ensure the final steps wire all components together.
