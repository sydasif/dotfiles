prompt = """
Perform a deep cleanup of the entire codebase.

Tasks:
- Detect and remove dead code, abandoned modules, unused functions, and stale variables.
- Eliminate common code smells: long functions, deeply nested logic, duplicate blocks, magic values, unclear naming, and unnecessary complexity.
- Reduce repetition by applying DRY principles.
- Replace confusing or misleading variable and function names.
- Delete unused imports, unused classes, unused constants, and unreachable code paths.
- Simplify conditional logic and refactor long functions into smaller units.
- Ensure behavior does not change.
- Run lint + format: `ruff check . --fix && ruff format .`
- Run all tests and confirm they pass.

Output:
Provide a file-by-file list of what was removed, refactored, or simplified.
