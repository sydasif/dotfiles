prompt = """
Act as a Software Architect. Analyze the current project structure (folders, modules, entry points).

1. **Evaluate**: Does it align with Clean Architecture? (Separation of concerns, modularity).
2. **Identify**: Point out monolithic scripts or tightly coupled logic.
3. **Propose**: A refactoring plan to move towards a scalable package layout.
4. **Onboarding**: Create a short guide on how to extend the project safely.

Do not rewrite code yet; focus on the structural layout.
