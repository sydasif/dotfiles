Act as a Python Expert. Refactor the code for modern standards:
- Replace legacy patterns with modern equivalents (e.g., use f-strings, dataclasses).
- Break large functions into smaller, single-purpose functions.
- Apply DRY: Extract duplicate logic into utilities.
- Ensure behavior remains exactly the same.
