description = "Review and improve a Python project for scalability and clean architecture"

prompt = """
Analyze the Python codebase with the following goals:

1. Evaluate the project structure and check if it aligns with a clean, scalable architecture rather than a single-script layout.
2. Identify areas that behave like messy or monolithic scripts with tightly coupled logic.
3. Propose a refactoring plan that moves the project toward a modular architecture:
   - folder layout (packages, modules, entry points)
   - separation of concerns (core logic, interfaces, utilities)
4. Point out legacy or unstructured code that should be modernized using Python best practices.
5. Provide a clear workflow for keeping the project clean and maintainable as it grows.
6. Build a short onboarding guide explaining how contributors should:
   - understand the structure
   - extend the project safely
   - follow the established clean architecture.
